# Amazon EKS Lab

This repository is a hands-on, project-based learning path to master Amazon EKS and Kubernetes on AWS using Terraform and kubectl.  It takes you from foundational skills like cluster setup and kubectl basics to advanced topics like GitOps, and service meshes.

Each project folder contains Terraform code, Kubernetes manifests, and documentation to help you learn EKS through real-world scenarios.

## Learning Philosophy

This lab follows a progressive tooling approach designed to maximize learning and minimize frustration:

- Start Simple: Begin with `eksctl` to focus on Kubernetes concepts without infrastructure complexity
- Build Understanding: Learn what AWS resources EKS needs and how they work together
- Graduate to Production: Transition to Terraform when managing complex, multi-environment setups
- Real-World Scenarios: Each project simulates actual production challenges you'll face

## Learning Roadmap
